# Mastering the Order of Execution

## Example Org Configuration

This repo contains metadata and data to recreate the Org configuration used in my presentation at French Touch Dreamin 2019 on September 20th, 2019.

Session Abstract:
It’s easy to build amazing solutions on the Lightning Platform with “clicks not code” automations and programmatic logic really fast. Yet, while the org grows, it’s getting harder and harder to make your solution robust and sustainable.
The “Save Order of Execution” is one of the most crucial points in designing applications that run smoothly and scale well. Admins and developers alike need the knowledge about the things that happen after you push the “Save” button to navigate around a major trouble spot.
I am going to guide you through the “Save Order of Execution” and showcase some typical trouble spots. You will learn how to remedy typical problems and how to design an app that is optimized for scale and performance in the database cycle.
